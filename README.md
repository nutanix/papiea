Papiea, pronounced like the fruit, is an Intent engine based on perscriptions or recipes for handling differences
between intended state and real world state.

# Design document
Please see [Papiea's design document](https://nutanix.github.io/papiea-js/Papiea-design.html)

# Build Instructions Papiea
Since papiea consists of multiple package you need to 
build them all separately or use a set of commands to build them all

1. In the project root install all dependencies `npm run install-all`.

2. In the project root build all packages `npm run build-all`.

# Local Development Instructions Papiea-Engine
Papiea-Engine is the main component that serves web requests and integrates intentful engine
with entity information stores in a database. Make sure that you have Docker and Docker-compose since they are required to run Papiea-Engine

1. In the project root cd into papiea engine package `cd papiea-engine`

2. To start a container `docker-compose up -d`

Papiea-Engine will now be running on port `3000` inside the container and will use port `3333` externally

To stop a container

1. `docker-compose stop`

# Debug configuration Papiea-Engine
Instead of using usual `docker-compose up` in papiea-engine dir, use `docker-compose -f docker-compose-debug.yml` to enable hot-reload and debugger listening on port `9229`

# Environment Papiea-Engine
A set of these variables might be used to tweak the default papiea-engine configuration
* `MONGO_HOST` - mongo host (default `mongo`)
* `MONGO_PORT` - mongo port (default `27017`)
* `PAPIEA_PUBLIC_ADDR` - external papiea address (default `"http://localhost:3000"`)
* `HOT_RELOAD` - use nodemon to autoreload papiea on code changes (default `false`)
* `DEBUG_LEVEL` - log level for [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) logging (default `common`)
* `PAPIEA_ADMIN_S2S_KEY` - papiea admin's s2s key

# CLJS instructions
For now this clojurescript library is embedded, but it may end up in a different repository and will be exposed as a regular npm package which will be imported through npm. Until this happens, here are the instructions for developing this library:

1. Make sure `leiningen` is installed (follow https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation)
1. To use live repl with clojurescript do the following:
```bash
cd papiea-lib-clj
lein repl
```
and inside the repl type:
```clojure
(require 'cljs.repl.nashorn)
(cider.piggieback/cljs-repl (cljs.repl.nashorn/repl-env))
```
Then go to emacs with cider installed (https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider#installation), do `M+x cider-connect-cljs`, select the host where the repl is running (usually localhost, but can be run anywhere. Use `.ssh/config` to name that host), then select `node` as the running environment and you should have a repl. Debugging is not yet working in cljs, but I simply use regular clojure if I need to live debug for now.
