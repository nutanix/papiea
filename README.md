Papiea, pronounced like the fruit, is an Intent engine based on perscriptions or recipes for handling differences
between intended state and real world state.

## Design document

Please see [Papiea's design document](https://nutanix.github.io/papiea/Papiea-design.html)

## Papiea versions:

| Component  | Version |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Engine (docker)  | 1298 |
| Client/SDK (typescript)  | 1.0.94 |
| Client/SDK (python)  | 96efe64d196ecc3ec3ef2d05980c1ab521211f6b |

## Build Instructions Papiea

Since papiea consists of multiple package you need to build them all
separately or use a set of commands to build them all

1. In the project root install and build all dependencies `make build_all`. (Note you need to have yarn installed
, how to install yarn https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Local Development Instructions Papiea-Engine

Papiea-Engine is the main component that serves web requests and integrates intentful engine
with entity information stores in a database. Make sure that you have Docker and Docker-compose since they are required to run Papiea-Engine

1. In the project root cd into papiea engine package `cd papiea-engine`

2. To start a container `docker-compose up -d`

Papiea-Engine will now be running on port `3000` inside the container and will use port `3333` externally

To stop a container

1. `docker-compose stop`

## Debug configuration Papiea-Engine

Instead of using usual `docker-compose up` in papiea-engine dir, use `docker-compose -f docker-compose-debug.yml up` to enable hot-reload and debugger listening on port `9229`

See [Attaching to node js using Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/running-and-debugging-node-js.html#a34dc5da)

## Benchmarking Local Papiea

1. Start papiea using `docker-compose up` in the papiea-engine dir

2. `docker-compose exec papiea-engine bash -c 'cd __benchmarks__ && npm i && npm run bench-local'`

## Benchmarking Dedicated Papiea

1. From project root `cd papiea-engine/__benchmarks__`

2. Install dependencies by `yarn` (Note you need to have yarn installed https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

3. `npm run bench -- {PAPIEA_URL} {PUBLIC_HOST} {PUBLIC_PORT}` where PAPIEA_URL is a dedicated papiea_url, PUBLIC_HOST is your sdk publicly visible hostname, PUBLIC_PORT is your sdk publicly visible port

OPTIONALLY: you can use AWS Cloudformation stack to setup benchmark environment, to do that you:

1. Upload `papiea-engine/__benchmarks__/aws_template/benchmark.json` as a template or use `https://papiea-bucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/benchmark.json`

2. SSH to mongo-instance 

3. Do `cd mongo && docker-compose -f docker-compose-mongo.yml up -d`

3. SSH to papiea-instance 

4. `export MONGO_URL='mongod://${MONGO_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP}:27017'`

5. `git clone https://github.com/nutanix/papiea-js.git`

6. `cd papiea-js/papiea-engine`

7. `docker-compose -f docker-compose-benchmark.yml up -d`

Now you can use your `${PAPIEA_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP}:3333` as PAPIEA_URL in benchmarks

## Environment Papiea-Engine

A set of these variables might be used to tweak the default papiea-engine configuration

* `MONGO_HOST` - mongo host (default `mongo`)
* `MONGO_PORT` - mongo port (default `27017`)
* `PAPIEA_PUBLIC_URL` - external papiea address (default `"http://localhost:3000"`)
* `HOT_RELOAD` - use nodemon to autoreload papiea on code changes (default `false`)
* `DEBUG_LEVEL` - log level for [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) logging (default `common`)
* `PAPIEA_ADMIN_S2S_KEY` - papiea admin's s2s key

## CLJS instructions

For now this clojurescript library is embedded, but it may end up in a different repository and will be exposed as a regular npm package which will be imported through npm. Until this happens, here are the instructions for developing this library:

1. Make sure `leiningen` is installed (follow [leiningen installation](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation))
2. To use live repl with clojurescript do the following:

    ```bash
    cd papiea-lib-clj
    lein repl
    ```

    and inside the repl type:

    ```clojure
    (require 'cljs.repl.nashorn)
    (cider.piggieback/cljs-repl (cljs.repl.nashorn/repl-env))
    ```

    Then go to emacs with cider installed
    ([Cider Installation](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider#installation)), do `M+x cider-connect-cljs`,
    select the host where the repl is running (usually localhost, but can be run anywhere.
    Use `.ssh/config` to name that host), then select `node` as the running environment and you should have a repl.
    Debugging is not yet working in cljs, but I simply use regular clojure if I need to live debug for now.
